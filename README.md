# Description
This project is based on a team effort as a part of CS 420 Software Engineering at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Designed and coded by Team 2, which consisted of Luke Norris, Kamya Patel, Willson Ellis, Zach Naden and Quinton Coley. 

The purpose of this app is to control or simulate a remote controlled drone to be used to perform basic aggricultural related tasks to automate some of the more
tedius ones. This includes monitoring farm crops and livestock, carrying supplies, watering, harvesting, planting, security footage and more. 

Within the app one can add new items and item containers such as livestock or crop areas and the type of livestock or crop that may populate them. The price, location and attributes of the item or container may be editted to display in the visualization pane. Subsequently either a physical or simulated drone may be used to fly to these items and complete tasks.
